# AI-Powered Research Assistant

## Overview
This AI-powered research assistant leverages multi-agent collaboration to fetch, analyze, and summarize research papers from various sources, including the web and arXiv. It is built using Streamlit and integrates Google's Gemini AI model along with web and academic research tools.

## Features
- **Web Research Agent**: Searches the web for relevant information and extracts key points with citations.
- **arXiv Research Agent**: Retrieves the most relevant academic papers from arXiv and summarizes them.
- **Summarization Agent**: Condenses research findings into concise, well-structured summaries.
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: A team of AI agents working together to ensure accurate citations and comprehensive research summaries.

## Technologies Used
- **Streamlit**: For interactive UI
- **Google Gemini API**: AI model for natural language understanding
- **DuckDuckGoTools**: Web search integration
- **ArxivTools**: Academic paper retrieval
- **Python**: Primary programming language
